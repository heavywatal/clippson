# clippson

[![Build status](https://github.com/heavywatal/clippson/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/heavywatal/clippson/actions)

This is a helper library of [muellan/clipp](https://github.com/muellan/clipp), the awesome C++ command-line parser.

- Support using [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) as a `boost::program_options::variables_map`-like object, which makes it possible to print all the variables at once to console/files in a computer-readable format.
- Create a pair of `clipp::option` and `clipp::value` (as a `clipp::group`) with a doc string including its default value.
- Use `std::sto***()` to validate arguments and convert strings.
  A proper function is chosen for each `clipp::value` based on the type of its target variable.
- Support comma separated values for vector targets, e.g., `-v 1,2,3`.
- Support limiting choices of values.
- Accept `=` as an optional separator of a flag and its value, e.g., `--longopt=value` is treated almost equally as `--longopt value`.
- Support `CMake` building system.


## Installation

The easiest way is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
The following command installs tumopp and all the dependencies:
```sh
brew install heavywatal/tap/clippson
```

Alternatively, you can get the source code from GitHub manually:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/heavywatal/clippson.git
cd clippson/
DESTINATION=${HOME}/local
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$DESTINATION
cmake --build build -j2
cmake --install build
```

`clippson.hpp` and the required headers, `clipp.h` and `json.hpp`, are installed to `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/clippson/`.

## Usage

Add `#include <clippson/clippson.hpp>` to your source code.
Functions are defined in the namespace `clippson::`.
The required headers `clipp.h` and `json.hpp` are included therein, hence their functions are available in the original namespaces.

See [test/example.cpp](https://github.com/heavywatal/clippson/blob/master/test/example.cpp) for more details.

This library can be imported as a CMake package:
```cmake
find_package(clippson REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_project PRIVATE clippson::clippson)
```
